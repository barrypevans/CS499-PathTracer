# CS499-PathTracer

<b>CS 499 Path Tracer is my independent study on progressive, Monte Carlo path tracing.</b>

<b>Objectives</b></br>
•	Learn the process of creating a progressive path tracer.</br>
•	Learn optimization techniques to bring the path tracer to acceptable rendering times.</br>
•	Understand and implement a physically accurate BSDF in the context of rays tracing.</br>

<b>Timeframe: Deliverable Start and End Dates</b></br>
•	Phase One - Simple BRDF Implementation - September 1st – 31st </br>
•	Phase Two	-  Parallelization, Triangle intersections and spatial partitioning - October 1st – October 31th </br>
•	Phase Three - BSDF, Progressive Rendering, Scene Loading - November 1st – November 30th </br>
• Phase Four - DOF, Motion Blur, and Bloom December 1st – 14th </br>


<b>Current State:</b></br>
Currently the path tracer can render spheres and planes with diffuse global illumnation.</br>
Next Event Estimate was recently implemented. This makes convergence about 10 times faster.</br>
